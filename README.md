# ZuliAir

I took on this project to learn more about Flutter, Dart, and mobile app development. It also came in handy for my girlfriend, who uses it to easily check her upcoming flights.

## To test it locally
1. Get an Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key from [Swedavia](https://apideveloper.swedavia.se/product#product=58c121aec40b3912f0d2a5f4) (you need to create an account and then subscribe, of course, at no cost).
2. Replace &#60;YOUR-KEY-HERE&#62; with your Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key in the flight_helper.dart file in the lib folder.
